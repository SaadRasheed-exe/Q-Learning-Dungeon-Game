# Dungeon Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple dungeon game using reinforcement learning techniques. The game is set in an 11 by 11 grid where an agent navigates through a dungeon, learning to maximize its rewards through exploration and interaction with the environment.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dungeon-rl-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the dungeon game, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Game Mechanics
- The game consists of an 11 by 11 grid where the agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- The agent receives rewards based on its actions and learns to navigate the dungeon effectively.
- The environment is reset after each episode, allowing the agent to start fresh and apply its learned strategies.
